**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

newssup - is an open source Android application which brings news updates to the user from various News API providers such as Google News, BBC News etc. User can select the API of his choice. The application lists various news sections like Top Stories, World News, Business, Technology etc under each API. The user can see the news headlines under each category.
